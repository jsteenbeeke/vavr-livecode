This repository contains demo code used during a presentation on [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/). There are two significant branches in this repository:

1. The **master** branch, which contains mostly empty demo classes
2. The **antwoorden** branch, which contains the demo classes with reference implementations of the problems sketched

The instructional text with each test method is written in Dutch.
